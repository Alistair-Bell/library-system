Library System
==============

About
-----
A simple library system that stores books persistantly.
Written in java and takes advantage of multiple source files.
This project would have been in my `java-sandbox` but was cleaner to use a new one.

Building
--------
Requires `make, java, javac`.
(build & run) `make all`
(build)       `make build`
(run)         `make run`
(clean)       `make clean`

If building fails make sure that the directory `out` exists.
